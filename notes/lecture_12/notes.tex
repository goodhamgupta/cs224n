    \item Phonetics is the sounds steam
    \item \textit{Phonemes}: Small sets of units used commonly by humans to communicate with each other
    \item \textit{Morphenes} Smallest sematic unit. Helps break down words into smaller units that have distinct meanings
    \item Difficult to work with morphenes though. Hence use character n-grams.
    \item Need to handle large, open vocab for word based models
