\section{Character-based convolutional encoder for NMT}
\subsection{Character embedding}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Character embeddings are lower in dim because:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Typically they consist of characters plus punctuation symbol. This small set of symbols are able to represent almost all words in the english language
        \item Using char embeddings we can obtain embeddings for OOV words as well
        \item Good for representing new words, emoticons, etc.
        \item Good for representing infrequent words which may be missing from the dataset
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Model size}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Character embedding
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $e_{char}$ = 50
        \item $V_{char} * e_{char} + e_{word} * k * e_{char} + 2 * (e_{word} * e_{word} + e_{word}$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Word embedding
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $V_{word} * e_{word}$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Advantage of CNN over RNN}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We know that RNN feed the output of sequence as the input to the next sequence. Bi-directional RNN learn from both forward and backward directions thereby creating contextual embeddings. HOWEVER, these embeddings can only take a window of words around it and they will compute the embeddings sequencially. CNN can learn different features using different kernels in parallel
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Max vs Avg pooling}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Max pooling
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Identifies the most important feature
        \item Discards other info that could potentially be useful
    \end{itemize}
    \item Avg pooling
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Gives every word equal importance. Preserve data info
        \item Incase there is one strong signal and multiple weak signals, it can dilute the important signal causing loss of information
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
